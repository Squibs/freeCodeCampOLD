### [jQuery Playground](https://codepen.io/Sulph/pen/aWEyaK) (Click to view functional site on Code-Pen)

<em>Completed May 04, 2017</em>

A playground used in several freeCodeCamp challenges teaching about how to use various jQuery commands. While this is not very much of a project to show off, I believe it is a good thing to recognize a simple project that allows you to test the many functions of jQuery. View project-notes.txt for notes on various commands that can be used with this.

2. [jQuery Functions](jquery-functions)
3. [More Notes](#more-notes)

##### Basic Notes

- jQuery is the most popular JavaScript tool of all time.
- All jQuery is done outside of HTML; in the head, or a seperate JavaScript file 
- Code put inside a document.dready function will run as soon as your browser has loaded your page.
	- Without the document ready function the code may run before your HTML is rendered which could cause bugs
- All jQuery functions start with $ (dollar sign operator, bling)
- ```$("STRING")``` is a selector; ```.addClass("animated bounce");``` is adding a css class to the selected
	- animated and bounce are both different classes in jQuery's library
		- an example line would read: ```$("STRING").addClass("animated bounce");```
	- Some ways to target various HTML elements:
		- ```$("button")``` select by type
		- ```$(".btn")``` select by class
		- ```$("#target1")``` select by ID

##### jQuery Functions

Several jQuery functions are (ways to manipulate html):
 - ```.addClass()``` Add a class to the target.
 - ```.removeClass()``` Remove a class from the target.
 - ```.css()``` Edit CSS of the target.
 	- For example ```.css("background-color", "blue");``` can be used to change the background-color to blue.
 - ```.prop()``` Edit the properties of the target.
 - ```.html()``` Add HTML tags and text within an element.
 - ```.text()``` Alters text only; won't evaluate HTML tags passed to it.
 - ```.remove()``` Removes an element.
 - ```.appendTo()``` Moves an element to another element.
 - ```.clone()``` Clones an element.
 - ```.parent()``` Access the parent of an element that is selected.
 	- For example ```$("#target1").parent().css("background-color", "red");``` can be used to change the background-color of the target1 id's parent's background-color to red.
 - ```.children()``` Access a child of an element that is selected.

##### More Notes

Function chaining allows you to combine jQuery functions. For example:
- For example: ```$("target5").clone().appendTo("#left-well");``` Uses both the ```.clone()``` and ```.appendTo()``` methods.

jQuery can use CSS Selectors to target elements:
- ```target:nth-child(n)```
	- ```$(".target:nth-child(3)").addClass("animated bounce");``` Targets the 3rd child of the target and addes the classes "animated" and "bounce".
- ```.target:odd``` Selects odd-numbered elements
	- jQuery is zero-indexed, meaning that, counter-intuitively, ```:odd``` selects the second, fourth and so on elements (index: 1, 3, 5...).
- ```target:even``` Selects even-numbered elements (index: 0, 2, 4...).
